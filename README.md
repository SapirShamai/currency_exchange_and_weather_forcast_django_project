This project is designed to broaden your understanding of requests and Django. It consists of two tasks: building a Currency Exchange app and a Weather Forecast app.

## Task 1: Currency Exchange App

The Currency Exchange app allows you to convert an amount from one currency to another. It requires the base currency, conversion currency, and the amount to be converted. The app retrieves the exchange rate information from the https://api.freecurrencyapi.com/v1/latest API. To use the app, follow these steps:

1. Enter the base currency, conversion currency, and amount to be converted in the provided input fields.
2. Click the "Convert" button.
3. The app will display the converted amount based on the current exchange rates.

## Task 2: Weather Forecast App

The Weather Forecast app provides weather information based on longitude and latitude coordinates. It retrieves weather data from the [Weatherbit API](https://www.weatherbit.io/). To use the app, follow these steps:

1. Enter the longitude and latitude values in the provided input fields.
2. Click the "Submit" button.
3. The app will display the weather information for the specified location.
